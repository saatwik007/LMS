Memory footprint is heavy; Java applications often require gigabytes of heap. The OOP-everything design can feel forced when functional patterns are more natural. Applets — Java's original web presence — died entirely. And the Oracle licensing changes for commercial use of the JDK after Java 11 caused significant enterprise concern and migration headaches.`

Netscape Navigator 2.0 shipped JavaScript in 1995. Microsoft responded with JScript in Internet Explorer, leading to a fractured ecosystem. This prompted Netscape to submit JavaScript to ECMA International for standardization, resulting in ECMAScript. The ES6 / ES2015 release was transformational — introducing classes, arrow functions, modules, Promises, and template literals. Annual releases now keep JavaScript evolving steadily.`
